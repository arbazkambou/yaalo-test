        "1": {
          "title": "What is an eSIM, and how does it work?",
          "body": "An eSIM is a built-in digital SIM that lets you activate mobile service without a physical card. It downloads a mobile plan directly to your phone and connects you to local networks instantly. For travelers, it removes the need to swap SIMs at airports or shops."
        },
        "2": {
          "title": "What are the downsides of eSIM?",
          "body": "The main downside of an eSIM is the need for a compatible device and a stable installation process. You cannot physically remove it like a normal SIM, and switching phones needs a transfer step. For most travelers, these limits are minor compared to the flexibility it offers."
        },
        "3": {
          "title": "Do eSIMs use your phone number?",
          "body": "Yes, an eSIM can use your phone number if your carrier supports number transfer. Travel eSIMs usually provide data only, so your WhatsApp, iMessage, and social apps still use your existing number. You can keep your primary SIM active for calls while using eSIM data."
        },
        "4": {
          "title": "Is getting an eSIM a good idea?",
          "body": "Yes, an eSIM is a smart choice because it offers fast setup, better security, and easy travel use. It helps you avoid roaming fees, airport SIM lines, and the risk of losing physical cards. Most travelers find eSIMs more convenient and cost-effective than traditional SIMs."
        },
        "5": {
          "title": "How do I contact an eSIM provider?",
          "body": "You can contact an eSIM provider through their app, help center, or 24/7 chat support. Most brands also offer email support and step-by-step troubleshooting inside the dashboard. Support is usually faster than physical carriers because everything is handled online."
        },
        "6": {
          "title": "How do I activate my eSIM?",
          "body": "You activate an eSIM by scanning a QR code or tapping an in-app install button. Your phone adds the eSIM profile inside Mobile/Cellular Settings and connects in minutes. It works the same whether you activate before travel or at your destination."
        },
        "7": {
          "title": "Does an eSIM give you a phone number?",
          "body": "A standard eSIM from your carrier can carry your phone number, just like a physical SIM. Travel eSIMs usually come as data-only, so they do not assign a new number for calls. All calling apps like WhatsApp, FaceTime, Messenger, still use your regular number."
        },
        "8": {
          "title": "Is an eSIM worth it?",
          "body": "Yes, an eSIM is worth it if you want cheaper data, safer connectivity, and no roaming surprises. You install it once, switch countries smoothly, and avoid handling tiny SIM trays. Frequent travelers save the most because plans are flexible and low-cost."
        },
        "9": {
          "title": "What are the risks of eSIM?",
          "body": "The main risk is installation errors if the QR code is scanned incorrectly or deleted early. Another is losing access if your phone is damaged, since the eSIM cannot be removed physically. Using a trusted provider reduces almost all eSIM-related issues."
        },
        "10": {
          "title": "Does eSIM drain battery?",
          "body": "No, an eSIM does not drain battery more than a physical SIM. Battery usage depends on network strength, background apps, and location services, not the eSIM itself. Most travelers see the same or better battery life when using eSIM data."
        },
        "11": {
          "title": "Do Smart eSIM cards allow you to text?",
          "body": "Yes, you can text through apps like WhatsApp, iMessage, and Telegram using an eSIM data plan. But Smart eSIM is still looking to get you the offer. Only carrier-issued eSIMs support regular SMS texting with your phone number. For travel, messaging apps replace SMS for most people."
        },
        "12": {
          "title": "Can I convert my SIM to eSIM?",
          "body": "Yes, many carriers let you convert a physical SIM to an eSIM through their app or account portal. You receive a QR code or activation link that moves your number to the eSIM profile. The process usually takes less than two minutes."
        },
        "13": {
          "title": "Is it better to have an eSIM or a physical SIM?",
          "body": "An eSIM is better for travel, flexibility, security, and switching networks without swapping cards. A physical SIM is useful only if your device is older or your carrier lacks eSIM support. Most new phones work best with eSIM as the main line."
        },
        "14": {
          "title": "Can eSIM cause problems?",
          "body": "eSIM issues are rare and usually come from incorrect installation or unsupported devices. Most problems are solved by reinstalling the profile or updating your phone settings. Trusted providers like Smart eSIM offer instant re-issues if something goes wrong."
        },
        "15": {
          "title": "Do eSIMs give you a local number?",
          "body": "Only carrier plans offer a local phone number for calls and SMS. Travel eSIMs provide data only, so you use your existing number through apps. If you need a real local number, you must buy a local voice plan."
        },
        "16": {
          "title": "Can I get a US number with eSIM?",
          "body": "Yes, if you purchase a US carrier eSIM or a virtual number service. Travel eSIMs for the US offer data but do not assign a US mobile number. VoIP apps like Google Voice can provide a US number if needed. Smart eSIM is data-only for now, but soon it will offer virtual numbers too."
        },
        "17": {
          "title": "Why shouldn’t I use an eSIM?",
          "body": "You may avoid eSIM only if your device is incompatible or if you need physical SIM swapping. Some users who frequently switch phones prefer physical cards. For most travelers, eSIM is the better, easier option."
        },
        "18": {
          "title": "How do I fix eSIM network issues?",
          "body": "You can fix eSIM issues by toggling Airplane Mode, restarting your phone, or resetting network settings. Sometimes selecting the correct network manually solves roaming or signal problems. The Smart eSIM app also includes a built-in troubleshooting guide."
        },
        "19": {
          "title": "Does deleting an eSIM cancel your service?",
          "body": "Deleting an eSIM removes the profile from your phone. Some eSIM providers follow the one-time removal policy. It means if you delete the eSIM profile, then you need to buy a new one to reuse. If you delete your Smart eSIM profile, you will need to buy it again because the service will be cancelled."
