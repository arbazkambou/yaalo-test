              "title": "What is Yaalo?",
              "body": "Yaalo is a travel eSIM provider built for people who want to stay connected without the fuss of roaming or plastic SIM cards. We make mobile data simple. At Yaalo, we care about your connectivity needs and let you roam the world (200+ destinations) without roaming charges."
            },
            "2": {
              "title": "What does Yaalo offer travellers?",
              "body": "Yaalo offers a wide range of data-only (Fixed & Unlimited) and data + voice + SMS eSIM plans. After buying the plan, whenever you land at a destination, you are automatically connected to the local carrier network. You can install it in minutes, manage it from your phone, and top up anytime through the Yaalo app"
            },
            "3": {
              "title": "Why choose Yaalo over other eSIM providers?",
              "body": "Because Yaalo keeps things honest and human, our prepaid plans come with transparent pricing, high-speed data, and live support that actually responds 24/7. With our growing coverage and instant activation, Yaalo has become a trusted name for travellers, even locals who care about convenience, security, and cost-saving connectivity."

            "1": {
              "title": "How much do Yaalo eSIM plans cost?",
              "body": "Yaalo keeps it simple. There is a transparent and easy pay-as-you-go policy. Whatever the data requirements, you can choose from the range of plans. Since all plans are prepaid, there are no sudden charges or thefts from your account. You will get pure connectivity with no restrictions on hotspot sharing and tethering. You can read details under every eSIM plan."
            },
            "2": {
              "title": "What is an eSIM profile?",
              "body": "An eSIM profile is your digital SIM identity. Like if you buy an eSIM for the USA, your plan information will be saved in the form of a profile. When the eSIM is activated, everything will work like a normal SIM does. As you are travelling internationally, you are still connected with local rates, not kilometre-long roaming charges."
            },
            "3": {
              "title": "How can I purchase or activate a Yaalo eSIM?",
              "body": "Buying and activating your Yaalo eSIM takes less than a minute. Pick your destination, select a data plan, and you’ll receive a QR code instantly by email. Scan it from your device’s settings to install. Prefer manual setup? You can enter the details manually, too. All the steps are mentioned in the Yaalo Blogs."
            },
            "4": {
              "title": "How are Yaalo eSIMs delivered after purchase?",
              "body": "After selection of suited eSIM plan and paying for it, enter your details, and you will receive an email. This email has a QR code to scan for automatic installation and an SM- DP Address for manual installation. Whatever you prefer, perform the steps and get connected in minutes."
            },
            "5": {
              "title": "What types of Yaalo eSIM plans are available?",
              "body": "Keeping in mind the globetrotters, the business lads, remote workers & digital nomads, a perfect range of Local, Regional, and Global eSIM plans is what you get. The plans are designed with data-only (Fixed and Unlimited) for short-termers with different styles of consuming data. But for people with heavy consumption and never missing a call or sms, Yaalo offers Data + Voice + SMS plans in selective destinations. Via Website or via Yaalo App, you can easily manage & top-up your eSIM profiles and plans."
            },
            "6": {
              "title": "Can I reuse my Yaalo eSIM for future trips?",
              "body": "Each Yaalo eSIM is linked to a specific plan and destination, so it can’t be reused for another trip. However, you can easily buy a new eSIM for your next destination in seconds through the Yaalo app or website."
            }

          "faqs": {
            "1": {
              "title": "How is eSIM different from a physical SIM?",
              "body": "An eSIM stores your mobile plan information so you can install a data plan without a plastic card. Functionally, it’s the same as a traditional SIM. It connects you to a carrier network, but it lets you add or switch plans in settings instead of swapping hardware."
            },
            "2": {
              "title": "How do I buy and activate a Yaalo eSIM?",
              "body": "Buy a plan on Yaalo, and we'll email you a QR code (or manual codes) right away. On your phone, go to: Settings → Mobile/Cellular → Add eSIM, then scan the QR or enter the details. Your eSIM installs in seconds and connects to the best local network once you enable mobile data. You can do that manually if you want to."
            },
            "3": {
              "title": "Can I install my Yaalo eSIM before I travel?",
              "body": "Yes! We also recommend installing your eSIM before your departure. Installing while on Wi-Fi at home ensures the profile is fully downloaded and avoids problems if a destination blocks certain provider websites or apps. That simple step gives you instant connectivity the moment you land."
            },
            "4": {
              "title": "How many eSIM profiles can my phone store? Can I use multiple at once?",
              "body": "It depends on the device specifications. Some phones can hold many profiles, but telling the exact number is possible when you read the specs. Still, typically only one profile is active at a time for data, though many devices support Dual SIM setups (one physical SIM + one eSIM active simultaneously)."
            },
            "5": {
              "title": "Does eSIM use more battery than a physical SIM?",
              "body": "No! The eSIM itself doesn’t materially change battery drain. What can use more power is running two active lines (two radios) or a poor network signal. Those conditions affect the battery, not the eSIM technology. Industry testing and operator reports confirm the difference is negligible."
            },
            "6": {
              "title": "Will a Yaalo eSIM give me 5G?",
              "body": "If your device and the local network support 5G, your Yaalo eSIM will work on 5G just like a physical SIM. eSIM is a provisioning method; 5G availability depends on the phone model and carrier coverage in the country you’re visiting."
            },
            "7": {
              "title": "What if my QR code won’t scan or my eSIM won’t install?",
              "body": "First, try with a stable Wi-Fi connection and restart your phone. If the QR still won’t scan, use the manual activation details we provided (SM-DP+ address/activation code). If you’re stuck, Yaalo’s support team is available 24/7 to walk you through the steps or resend the activation link."
            },
            "8": {
              "title": "Can I switch carriers or plans on the same device?",
              "body": "Yes! Switching is one of eSIM’s strengths. You can remove old profiles and add new ones from different providers right in settings. For travel, this means you can keep your home SIM active for calls and add a local Yaalo eSIM for data without swapping physical cards."
            },
            "9": {
              "title": "Do Yaalo plans include phone numbers, voice, and SMS?",
              "body": "Most Yaalo plans are data-first. You will also find data + voice + SMS plans for several destinations. If a plan includes a phone number, it will be clearly labeled in the plan details. Data-only eSIMs do not provide a separate phone number unless explicitly stated."
            },
            "10": {
              "title": "How long do Yaalo eSIM plans last, and can I top up?",
              "body": "Plan validity varies by the product you choose (e.g., 1 day, 7 days, 30 days). All Yaalo plans are prepaid, and many are extendable. You can top up from the Yaalo app or website when you need more data. "
            },
            "11": {
              "title": "Are Yaalo eSIMs secure? What about privacy?",
              "body": "Yes. eSIM profiles are delivered over encrypted provisioning channels, and the profile itself is stored on the device’s secure chip (eUICC). Because there’s no physical card to lose, common risks like SIM swapping or physical cloning are reduced. Yaalo follows privacy best practices and never shares your personal data without consent. But if you are an often-visitor to the same destination, you can save profiles and just top up from the Yaalo app before departure."
